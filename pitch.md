Optimizes for travel options
that produce less CO2: train, bus, ship =>



* Remove index
* The problem: mass tourism
* The Challenge (no s)
* third solution slide with more results and expanded options for one
* Alternatives -> Why:
* Stack, challenge:
  * ":" -> "->"
  * "while we get access…" -> "for now"
* Roadmap
  * put numbers in Roadmap
  * Put scrapping in the end
  * "…" at the end of Portugal
* Team: put it before roadmap


# Pitch
* What problem are you solving and why is it important?
  * People have some free time and some money, but don't know where to go. They might be tired of the usual destinations, they might've visited them already, or they might be too far away/expensive for their budget if they're not planning far-ahead.
  * There are tons of touristy destinations that are not in people's minds, that might be cheaper, more novel, more "authentic"
  * ninu solves this by asking the traveler for their budget and dates only, and provides a curated set of destinations that are more sustainable, novel and less traveled.
* What is unique about it?
  * wayinabox -> surprise, but only top tourist destinations
  * kiwi, skyscanner, etc -> top destinations, not budget oriented
  * travel agencies: offline
  * all of them: not focused in less traveled, sustainable destinations
* How does it relate to the three main topics?
  * Sustainability:
    * Optimizes for travel options that produce less CO2: train, bus, ship
    * Surfaces less traveled destinations to distribute tourism
* Demo
* Stack, data, APIs
  * Stack: Ruby on Rails, Heroku
  * APIS: Tequila kiwi.com: Location, Search, more APIs for trains and buses
* Were there any tech challenges you needed to overcome?
  * No easy source for hotels: faked data while we get access to Booking and Expedia APIs
